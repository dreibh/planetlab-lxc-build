groupname: rvm-ruby
groupdesc: rvm and pre-installed ruby for easily deploying omf-rc as a gem
# unfortunately the rvm-ruby build got broken on f18 at some point because of 
# changes in openssl - see lxc.mk
# however it's best to define a valid extension here because otherwise
# the omf sliceimage is not known, and slices cannot be instantiated
